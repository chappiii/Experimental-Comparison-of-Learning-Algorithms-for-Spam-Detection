# Experimental Comparison of Learning Algorithms for Spam Detection

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that compares three classification algorithms—**Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**—for spam detection. The evaluation uses stratified 10-fold cross-validation and assesses each model based on training time, accuracy, and F1 score. Statistical tests (Friedman and Nemenyi) are also performed to determine significant differences among the models.
